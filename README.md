# Front-end challenge

Welcome to my front-end Mercadolibre challenge solution. I'll explain how to run my react app. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It's important to have node installed. If you don't have it, install it please.

### Installing

After cloning the repo https://github.com/camilasosamorales/ml-test-search.git, you should go to the root folder and run

#### `npm install                                                                                                  `

It will install all the recuried dependencies.

Also run it on the client folder. 

### Running
Once all the dependencies are installed, run the express server. On the root folder, run the command

#### `node server.js                                                                                                  `

It will run the express server on port 5000.

Now, run the react app. Go to the client folder

#### `npm start                                                                                                  `

It will launch the app on http://localhost:3000
