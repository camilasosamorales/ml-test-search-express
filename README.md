# Front-end challenge

Welcome to my front-end Mercadolibre challenge solution. I'll explain how to run my react app. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It's important to have node installed. If you don't have it, install it please.

### Installing

After cloning the repo https://github.com/camilasosamorales/ml-test-search-express.git, you should go to the root folder and run

#### `npm install                                                                                                  `

It will install all the recuried dependencies.

Also run it on the client folder. 

### Running
Once all the dependencies are installed, go to the client folder and run

#### `npm run dev                                                                                                  `

It will launch the app on http://localhost:3000
